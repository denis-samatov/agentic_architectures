Welcome to a comprehensive, hands-on masterclass on **designing modern AI agents**. This repository contains detailed implementations of **23 state-of-the-art agent architectures**, built with LangChain and LangGraph. It's designed as a "living textbook" that bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and runnable, educational example code.

## 📖 Why this repository?

The field of AI agents is evolving at an incredible pace, but many resources remain abstract and theoretical. This project was created to provide a structured, practical, and deeply educational path for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to master the art of building intelligent systems.

-   **From theory to tangible code:** Every architecture is not just explained, but implemented end to end in a runnable Jupyter notebook.
-   **A structured learning path:** The notebooks are ordered to build concepts progressively, from foundational patterns to highly advanced, multi-agent, and self-aware systems.
-   **A focus on evaluation:** We don't just build agents, we measure them. Many notebooks include a robust `LLM-as-a-Judge` pattern to provide quantitative, objective feedback on agent performance — a critical skill for production AI.
-   **Real-world scenarios:** Examples are grounded in practical applications — financial analysis, coding, social media management, medical triage — making the concepts immediately applicable.
-   **A single, modern framework:** Using `LangGraph` as the primary orchestrator, you'll learn a powerful, stateful, and cyclical approach to agent design that is quickly becoming the industry standard.

## 🗺️ A Tour of the Architectures

The repository is structured to walk you from simple enhancements to building truly complex, multi-agent, self-aware systems.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand the learning path</b></summary>

#### Part 1: Foundational Patterns (Notebooks 1-4)
This section covers the core building blocks for enhancing a single agent.
- We start with **Reflection** to improve output quality.
- Then we give the agent **Tools** to interact with the world.
- **ReAct** combines these into a dynamic loop.
- Finally, **Planning** adds foresight and structure to its actions.

#### Part 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Notebooks 5, 7, 11, 13)
Here we explore how to make agents work together.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** introduces the concept of specialized teams.
- **Meta-Controller** acts as an intelligent router, distributing tasks across those teams.
- **Blackboard** provides a flexible, shared workspace for dynamic collaboration.
- The **Ensemble** pattern runs multiple agents in parallel for more reliable and diverse analysis.

#### Part 3: Advanced Memory and Reasoning (Notebooks 8, 9, 12)
This section focuses on how agents can think more deeply and remember what they've learned.
- **Episodic + Semantic Memory** provides a powerful, human-like memory system.
- **Graph World-Model** enables complex reasoning over interconnected knowledge.
- **Tree of Thoughts** provides systematic, multi-path exploration for solving hard logical problems.

#### Part 4: Safety, Reliability, and Real-World Interaction (Notebooks 6, 10, 14, 17)
These architectures are critical for building agents that can be trusted in production.
- **Dry-Run Harness** provides a critical human-in-the-loop safety layer.
- **Simulator** lets an agent "think before it acts" by modeling consequences.
- **PEV** builds in automatic error detection and recovery.
- The **Metacognitive** agent understands its own limitations, which is key to safe operation in high-stakes domains.

#### Part 5: Learning and Adaptation (Notebooks 15, 16)
The final section explores how agents can improve over time and solve problems in new ways.
- **Self-Improvement Loop** builds a mechanism for the agent to learn from feedback, similar to RLHF.
- **Cellular Automata** demonstrates how complex global behavior can emerge from simple local rules, producing highly adaptive systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local environment and run the notebooks.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/all-agentic-architectures.git
cd all-agentic-architectures
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

Using a virtual environment to manage dependencies is strongly recommended.

```bash
# On Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install all required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may also need to install `pygraphviz` to visualize LangGraph graphs.

> **Note:** `requirements.txt` is the authoritative dependency list — install from it as shown above. `pyproject.toml` in this repo only configures `ruff` (linting/formatting) and declares no dependencies or build metadata.

### 4. Configure environment variables

The agents need API keys to run. Create a file named `.env` in the project root. You can look at `requirements.txt` to see what's needed, then build your own `.env` file.

Open the `.env` file and add your credentials. It should look like this:

```python
# .env file

# Nebius AI API Key (for LLM access)
NEBIUS_API_KEY="your_nebius_api_key_here"

# LangSmith API Key (for tracing and debugging)
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key_here"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="All-Agentic-Architectures" # Optional: set a project name

# Tavily Search API Key (for the research agent's tool)
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"

# Neo4j Credentials (for the Graph and Memory architectures)
# You need a running Neo4j instance (e.g. via Docker or Neo4j Desktop)
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="your_neo4j_password_here"
```

### 5. Run the notebooks

You can now start Jupyter and explore the notebooks in numerical order.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
